"""Oracle NoSQL access — tables, indexes, conditional writes (plan §8, D5).

System of record = Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service, accessed via the
``oci.nosql`` module (part of the ``oci`` package). Local SQLite is a read-through
cache for regenerable data (compliance whitelist, conId map, recent bars); the
authoritative state — tax lots, positions, triplet state, realized P&L, order
intents, risk state, IBKR session, SEC compliance — lives in NoSQL. **No
Autonomous DB, no oracledb, no SQLAlchemy** (D5).

Why NoSQL + conditional writes (plan §8, §19 "NoSQL transaction boundaries"):
HIFO lot selection + lot closure + triplet advance must be **atomic**. NoSQL
conditional writes are the concurrency/atomicity boundary — a put/delete only
succeeds if a server-side predicate over the row's current state holds. Two
concurrent sells against the same lot cannot both close it: the second write
sees the lot's `status` already flipped to `closed` (or its version bump) and
fails with `ConditionalCheckFailed`. The same fence guards triplet slot
advances. This module is the single home for that boundary; the ledger and
triplet modules call into these helpers instead of raw puts.

Two backends share one Protocol:

  * ``InMemoryNoSqlStore`` — an exact mirror of NoSQL conditional-write
    semantics, used in CI and the hypothesis property tests. It is not a toy:
    its ``threading.Lock`` makes each conditional write atomic against other
    threads, so the atomicity property tests are meaningful (concurrent writers
    cannot both succeed against the same row).

  * ``OciNoSqlStore`` — the real backend. Lazily imports ``oci`` so the default
    ``uv sync --extra dev`` install (CI) does not require the heavy SDK; the
    extra ``oci`` (pyproject ``[project.optional-dependencies]``) is installed
    on the podman primary and any environment that touches the real tenancy.

The conditional-write helper vocabulary (named after the NoSQL ``putOption``
semantics it mirrors):

  * ``put_if_absent``   — InsertOnly; succeeds only if no row exists at the key.
                         Used for ``order_intent`` (idempotent order creation)
                         and new ``tax_lots`` (a fresh lot_id must be unique).
  * ``update_if_version`` — IfVersion; succeeds only if the row exists AND its
                         ``version`` equals ``expected_version``. This is the
                         optimistic-concurrency fence used by HIFO lot closure
                         and triplet slot advance.
  * ``update_if_condition`` — IfVersion + an arbitrary predicate over the
                         pre-update row; the update applies atomically only if
                         the version matches AND the predicate holds. Used for
                         "close the lot only if its status is still 'open' and
                         qty matches expected".
  * ``delete_if_version`` — IfVersion on a delete.
  * ``get`` / ``query``  — point lookup by primary key / secondary index lookup.

Every successful write returns the new ``Row`` (with a fresh ``version``); every
failed conditional write raises ``ConditionalCheckFailed``. The version is an
opaque server-assigned string (the OCI SDK returns it as a bytes/blob; the
in-memory backend uses a monotonic counter encoded as a string).

        predicate for ``update_if_condition`` is evaluated client-side against
        the row's current payload (read with ``get`` first under the same
        caller) — the server-side fence is the version match; the predicate is
        an additional caller-side guard. For pure server-side condition
        predicates, callers can use the SDK's ``condition`` field directly; this
        wrapper keeps the predicate in Python so the same test suite covers
        both backends.

    Construction is intentionally cheap and deferred; the heavy client is
    created lazily so importing this module never requires the SDK.
